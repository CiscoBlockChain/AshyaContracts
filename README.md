# Ashya Registry

Smart Contracts for Ashya Project

We have two contracts here:

* Ashya Registry (used by the server)
* Ashya Device (used by the devices)

Each device initializes with a device contract that automatically registers it with the Registry.  The Registry advertises the existing devices.

Another Repository AshyaServer holds the server code that interacts and displays the Ashya Registry Smart contract
